# Water Quality Prediction - AICTE Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

## Project Overview

This project, developed as part of the AICTE AI/ML Internship, focuses on building a machine learning model to predict water quality. The primary goal is to determine whether water is safe for consumption based on various physicochemical parameters provided in a dataset. Users will be able to input these parameters, and the model will output a prediction indicating the water's safety status.

## Problem Statement

Access to safe drinking water is crucial for public health. This project addresses the challenge of quickly and accurately assessing water quality without the need for complex laboratory tests for every sample. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to provide a rapid and accessible tool to evaluate water safety based on easily measurable parameters.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the `PB_All_2000_2021.csv` dataset, which contains water quality parameters collected between 2000 and 2021. The dataset is delimited by semicolons.

* **File Name:** `PB_All_2000_2021.csv`
* **Features:**
    * `id`: Unique identifier for the sampling location/record.
    * `date`: Date of the sample collection.
    * `NH4`: Ammonium concentration.
    * `BSK5`: Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5).
    * `Suspended`: Suspended solids.
    * `O2`: Oxygen concentration.
    * `NO3`: Nitrate concentration.
    * `NO2`: Nitrite concentration.
    * `SO4`: Sulfate concentration.
    * `PO4`: Phosphate concentration.
    * `CL`: Chloride concentration.
 ## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
* Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
