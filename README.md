# Water Quality Prediction - AICTE Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.
## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the AICTE AI/ML Internship, focuses on building a machine learning model to predict water quality. The primary goal is to determine whether water is safe for consumption based on various physicochemical parameters provided in a dataset. Users will be able to input these parameters, and the model will output a prediction indicating the water's safety status.
## Problem Statement
Access to safe drinking water is crucial for public health. This project addresses the challenge of quickly and accurately assessing water quality without the need for complex laboratory tests for every sample. By leveraging machine learning, this project aim to provide a rapid and accessible tool to evaluate water safety based on easily measurable parameters.
## Dataset
The project utilizes the PB_All_2000_2021.csv dataset, which contains water quality parameters collected between 2000 and 2021.  The dataset is delimited by semicolons. 

File Name: PB_All_2000_2021.csv
Features:
id: Unique identifier for the sampling location/record. 
date: Date of the sample collection. 
NH4: Ammonium concentration. 
BSK5: Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5). 
Suspended: Suspended solids. 
O2: Oxygen concentration. 
NO3: Nitrate concentration. 
NO2: Nitrite concentration. 
SO4: Sulfate concentration. 
PO4: Phosphate concentration. 
CL: Chloride concentration. 
##Here's an updated README.md file for your project, incorporating details from the PB_All_2000_2021.csv file you provided.

I've listed the features (columns) from your CSV file under the "Dataset" section. However, based on the provided data, I don't see an explicit column that indicates whether the water is "safe" or "unsafe" (your target variable for prediction). You will need to either:

Add a column to your PB_All_2000_2021.csv file that clearly indicates the potability/safety of the water (e.g., 'Potability', 'Safety', with binary values like 0/1 or True/False).
Or, if water safety is to be derived from a combination of these parameters based on certain thresholds, you'll need to define that logic as part of your data preprocessing step.
Please clarify how you intend to define the "safety" of the water from these parameters, so I can update the README.md accordingly.
